# Finding Complex Boundaries using Linear Regression

In this we are actually adding more features to our dataset using existing features.<br>
Addition of more features is nothing but we are just trying to make our algorithm learn more i.e how my output is dependent upon input features.<br>
For doing the same, first I have found the score for original boston dataset using Linear Regression.<br>
And then I have added more columns(multiplication of each column to every other column) to improve the score. And by doing the same my algorithm is doing much better on testing data.
